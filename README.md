### for co-pilot
- keep it simple
- minimal possible code
- prefer declarative style
- ask permission before major changes
- ask questions if unsure how to proceed
- explain what you are thinking, but avoid long summaries of what changed
- don't assume I am right, read the code and refer to web documentation if stuck
